<p><strong>The Dexlansoprazole Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</li><li>Heal Erosive Esophagitis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dexlansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used primarily to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and heal erosive esophagitis. In GERD, it reduces stomach acid production, alleviating symptoms like heartburn and regurgitation. For erosive esophagitis, resulting from acid damage to the esophagus, dexlansoprazole promotes healing by decreasing acid secretion, enhancing mucosal protection. The growing prevalence of these conditions drives demand for dexlansoprazole in the healthcare market, offering effective management and improved quality of life for affected patients.</p></p>
