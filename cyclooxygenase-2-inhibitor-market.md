<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li><li>Non-Selective Cox 2 Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor market is primarily categorized into selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors. Selective COX-2 inhibitors specifically target the COX-2 enzyme, providing pain relief with reduced gastrointestinal side effects compared to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Conversely, non-selective COX-2 inhibitors affect both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, offering broader anti-inflammatory effects but with a higher risk of gastrointestinal complications. This distinction influences therapeutic uses, side effect profiles, and market demand within the pharmaceutical landscape.</p></p>
