<p><strong>The Retinal Detachment Diagnostic Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment</li><li>Exudative Retinal Detachment</li><li>Tractional Retinal Detachment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retinal detachment diagnostic market encompasses the assessment of three primary types: rhegmatogenous, exudative, and tractional retinal detachment. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment arises from a tear in the retina, leading to fluid accumulation. Exudative detachment involves fluid build-up beneath the retina due to underlying conditions, such as inflammation or tumors. Tractional retinal detachment occurs when scar tissue pulls the retina away from its supporting tissue. Advanced diagnostic technologies are essential for timely detection and intervention, enhancing patient outcomes across these conditions.</p></p>
